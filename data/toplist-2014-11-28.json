At the same time,\nattention is also being paid to the woeful state of development data – we know\nthe least about those who are most lacking, and people often lack the\ninformation and capacities they need to bring about change. Unsurprisingly this\nhas led to a focus on how we can harness the potential of the new and rapidly\nevolving digital landscape to meet some of these acute data gaps, and more profoundly,\nto improve policymaking and citizen empowerment. But while some insist that Big\nData may provide an opportunity to ‘leapfrog’ statistical systems in developing\ncountries, others argue that Big Data is largely Big Hype, and that traditional\nstatistical concerns and methods limit its applications for official\nstatistics. And new concerns altogether are emerging including around privacy\nand ownership of personal data. This public panel discussion is organised by the Overseas\nDevelopment Institute, Data-Pop Alliance and the Royal Statistical Society. It\nbrings together leading experts who will explore the potential of Big Data to\ntransform national statistical systems as well as concerns about the\nreliability and representativeness of these data, and over ethics, privacy, and\nthe blurring of lines between formal and informal data sources.   To register for this event, please email events@rss.org.uk  \n","Image":"http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/images/969.jpg","TweetIds":["538227363817873408","538257755245522944","538354183376601089","538218537827831810","538389828220379136","538392853576417280","538396173271572480","538125407665393664","538417311091159041","538425225462169600"]}]}
