Digitized data has been around for a while now, too (think virtual folders in hard drives connected to seemingly bottomless computer networks). So why, in just the past few years, have all of us become so excited about and actually engaged in data? We even decided to give it a new name—“big” data. Where did all this excitement come from? Why is it happening? If you asked Tom Breur, Cengage Learning’s VP of Analytics who spoke about big data at NEMRA’s Spring into Action event earlier this year, he would tell you that it’s because there has been a recent surge in data volume (mostly thanks to the emergence of machine-generated data and machine-to-machine communication). This surge led to an ever-expanding data surplus—a surplus that would not have had a home if it weren’t for subsequent innovations in the type of software that manages huge amounts of data and the innovations that led to much more efficient data warehousing capabilities.","Image":"http://loyalty360.org/assets/images/theme/loyalty360-logo.png","TweetIds":["536651747180433408"]},{"CreatedAt":"2014-11-22T00:31:01Z","Vote":26,"Url":"http://www.wired.com/2014/11/how-big-data-is-revolutionizing-design/?utm_content=bufferb97a0\u0026utm_medium=social\u0026utm_source=twitter.com\u0026utm_campaign=buffer","Title":"How Big Data Is Revolutionizing Design","Description":"Picture an architect laboring over a blueprint, or an auto designer working out the basics of next year’s model.
