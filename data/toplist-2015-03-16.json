I'll first introduce brain images and to derive statistical features. Then I'll discuss how prediction from these images is useful for diagnostic purposes, but also as a windows to understand the brain. I'll highlight specific challenges that arise when learning predictive models from brain maps, and details solutions put forward by our group, namely spatial penalties. Moving beyond well-posed statistical maps, I'll show how a combination of unsupervised modeling and supervised learning can predict phenotypic traits from spontaneous brain activity, recorded without controlling the subjects behavior. Finally, I'll detail how our work builds upon and nourishes a Python software stack that we leverage to interact with practitioners.","Image":"http://hydro.ijs.si/v010/b5/wvpi2zrf2xh6mrvywkemkeq4ooowpevk.jpg","TweetIds":["577047200276090880"]},{"CreatedAt":"2015-03-15T07:59:00Z","Vote":31,"Url":"http://www.fastcodesign.com/3031368/slicker-city/how-crowdsourcing-and-machine-learning-will-change-how-we-design-cities?utm_content=buffer26dc9\u0026utm_medium=social\u0026utm_source=twitter.com\u0026utm_campaign=buffer","Title":"How Crowdsourcing And Machine Learning Will Change The Way We Design Cities","Description":"Researchers at MIT Media Lab are using crowdsourced data to create an algorithm that determines how safe a street looks to the human eyeinformation...","Image":"http://f.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2014/06/3031368-poster-p-shutterstock127497947.png","TweetIds":["577576401576058880"]},{"CreatedAt":"2015-03-16T17:22:59Z","Vote":27,"Url":"http://pace.sdsc.edu/boot-camps","Title":"Predictive Analytics Center of Excellence","Description":"","Image":"http://www.wrsc.org/sites/default/files/resize/remote/0e2d988344296897c5dc90eac6fd0b1a-32x32.png","TweetIds":["577523544382414848","577534802460545024","577534914515636224","577535004424687617","577535270662356992","577535643993182209","577536615658192896","577536799406448640","577536923302014976","577537101312487425","577537241477697536","577537466535714817","577537619598381056","577537927229603840","577538105197998080","577538284357832704","577538763372527616","577538896365510656","577554615194939393","577555118884712448","577555789822369792","577558906177638400","577559262475333632","577559781725999104"]},{"CreatedAt":"2015-03-16T07:53:16Z","Vote":24,"Url":"http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/csevideo/Sergey.Levine.mp4","Title":"Deep Learning for Decision Making and Control – Sergey Levine (UC Berkeley): http://t.co/tok1oHDe3A Comments: https://t.co/uJux77Xsu7","Description":"","Image":"","TweetIds":["577378780236288001"]},{"CreatedAt":"2015-03-15T01:36:01Z","Vote":24,"Url":"http://moz.com/blog/deep-learning-machine-learning-future-of-seo-whiteboard-friday?utm_content=bufferc40e1\u0026utm_medium=social\u0026utm_source=twitter.com\u0026utm_campaign=buffer","Title":"What Deep Learning and Machine Learning Mean For the Future of SEO","Description":"In today's Whiteboard Friday, Rand explores a future marked by machine learning, where Google's ranking algorithm updates itself based on potentially countless inputs.","Image":"http://d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/og_image/54f8bc1db95650.42711416.jpg","TweetIds":["577561110817177600","577590484392095744"]},{"CreatedAt":"2015-03-16T20:48:53Z","Vote":22,"Url":"http://www.yrdsb.ca/Programs/PLT/Quest/Pages/default.aspx","Title":"\u0009\n\u0009\n\u0009\n\u0009\u0009\u0009Pages \n\u0009\u0009\u0009- The Quest for Increased Student Achievement and Well-Being\n\u0009\u0009","Description":"","Image":"http:///Programs/PLT/Quest/PublishingImages/Twitter.jpg","TweetIds":["577575501776187392","577574599640100864","577573459070459904","577572680108486656","577572265795129344"]},{"CreatedAt":"2015-03-15T17:01:13Z","Vote":21,"Url":"http://www.datasciencecentral.com/forum/topics/great-machine-learning-infographics","Title":"Great Machine Learning Infographics","Description":"Originally posted by Shivon Zillis (Bloomber beta investor) at Shivonzillis.com.\n\nDSC Resources\n\nCareer: Training | Books | Cheat Sheet | Apprenticeship | Cert…","Image":"http://api.ning.com:80/files/YsTyeLVttohSTLjaA45XIQLJC8pY1kWzfOqAkNEbYRZFYVPi2QuCWoRTXzni7e8xE82VlJAtmv6KlYSXDgMHVUZ4Cj81SnTl/bor55.PNG","TweetIds":["577152583078391808","577440608698146818"]},{"CreatedAt":"2015-03-15T04:22:25Z","Vote":21,"Url":"http://rightrelevance.com/?q=tab_type%3D2%26searchType%3Dfeeds%26start%3D0%26rows%3D30%26location%3D%26isPerson%3D%26articleId%3Dc1444a3d3a60615ac6956a4caf136f2148392603%26value%3Dtext%20analytics%26taccount%3Dml_toparticles%26topic%3Dtext%20analytics","Title":"Search or Login for deep topical relevance","Description":"","Image":"http://www.rightrelevance.com/assets/images/cover.png","TweetIds":["577556335283163136"]},{"CreatedAt":"2015-03-15T10:19:33Z","Vote":20,"Url":"http://iknowfirst.com/machine-learning-trading-up-to-34-40-return-in-14-days","Title":"Machine Learning Trading: Up To 34.40% Return In 14 Days","Description":"Machine Learning Trading: Up To 34.40% Return In 14 Days - Stock Forecast Based On a Predictive Algorithm | I Know First | .
