As we work to define this field it is important that we always have access to the growing landscape of data science concepts, and understand how they branch from high level approaches to specific implementations. In an effort to mix a birds-eye view of this growing landscape with the ability to drill down and learn the concepts, I decided to capture data science approaches and tools visually in an expandable ontology visualization.  ","Image":"http://assets.thoughtworks.com/marketo/images/og_image.jpg","TweetIds":["544144784118407169"]},{"CreatedAt":"2014-12-14T13:00:09Z","Vote":50,"Url":"http://dataconomy.com/data-science-interviews-what-can-you-expect/?utm_content=bufferc8fb4\u0026utm_medium=social\u0026utm_source=twitter.com\u0026utm_campaign=buffer","Title":"Data Science interviews: What can you expect?","Description":"","Image":"http://dataconomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/7464456288_9f1065dfe8_o.jpg","TweetIds":["544114629501521920"]},{"CreatedAt":"2014-12-13T13:15:04Z","Vote":36,"Url":"http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/13-new-trends-in-big-data-and-data-science?utm_content=9839392\u0026utm_medium=social\u0026utm_source=twitter","Title":"13 New Trends in Big Data and Data Science","Description":"Based on requests from clients - vendors of data processing platforms and products - as well as trends in popular blogs,  job postings, and my own reading.
