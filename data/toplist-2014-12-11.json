As we work to define this field it is important that we always have access to the growing landscape of data science concepts, and understand how they branch from high level approaches to specific implementations. In an effort to mix a birds-eye view of this growing landscape with the ability to drill down and learn the concepts, I decided to capture data science approaches and tools visually in an expandable ontology visualization.  ","Image":"http://assets.thoughtworks.com/marketo/images/og_image.jpg","TweetIds":["543190101292244992","543190830828507136","543190860083757058","543190865498619905"]},{"CreatedAt":"2014-12-10T23:37:16Z","Vote":41,"Url":"http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/new-selection-of-40-machine-learning-big-data-ressources-and","Title":"63 Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data Resources and Articles","Description":"Starred articles were potential candidates for our picture of the week published in our weekly digest.
