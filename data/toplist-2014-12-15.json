As we work to define this field it is important that we always have access to the growing landscape of data science concepts, and understand how they branch from high level approaches to specific implementations. In an effort to mix a birds-eye view of this growing landscape with the ability to drill down and learn the concepts, I decided to capture data science approaches and tools visually in an expandable ontology visualization.  ","Image":"http://assets.thoughtworks.com/marketo/images/og_image.jpg","TweetIds":["544616889998389248","544640689649500162"]},{"CreatedAt":"2014-12-14T13:00:11Z","Vote":31,"Url":"http://dataconomy.com/data-science-interviews-what-can-you-expect/?utm_content=bufferc8fb4\u0026utm_medium=social\u0026utm_source=twitter.com\u0026utm_campaign=buffer","Title":"Data Science interviews: What can you expect?","Description":"","Image":"http://dataconomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/7464456288_9f1065dfe8_o.jpg","TweetIds":["544349517643251712"]},{"CreatedAt":"2014-12-15T14:03:12Z","Vote":31,"Url":"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/booz-allen-hamilton-kaggle-launch-140000182.html?soc_src=mediacontentsharebuttons\u0026soc_trk=tw","Title":"Booz Allen Hamilton and Kaggle Launch Inaugural National Data Science Bowl","Description":"From Yahoo Finance: Booz Allen Hamilton, the management and technology consulting firm, and Kaggle, the leading online data science competition community, today announced the launch of the inaugural National Data Science Bowl.","Image":"http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/6rik6AZwuPGCiADf_9dhPQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT03NTt3PTYwMA--/http://l.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png","TweetIds":["544531762982842368"]},{"CreatedAt":"2014-12-15T17:30:10Z","Vote":29,"Url":"http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/12/data-science-skills-most-demand.html?utm_source=twitterfeed\u0026utm_medium=twitter\u0026utm_campaign=Feed%3A+kdnuggets-data-mining-analytics+%28KDnuggets%3A+Data+Mining+and+Analytics%29","Title":"Most Demanded Data Science and Data Mining Skills","Description":"","Image":"http:///images/kdnuggets-us-jobs-2014-sas-vs-r.jpg","TweetIds":["544614176232992768"]},{"CreatedAt":"2014-12-15T15:23:57Z","Vote":26,"Url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/review-data-science-at-the-command-line/","Title":"Review: Data Science at the Command Line","Description":"Admission: I didn’t really know how computers worked until around 2012.
